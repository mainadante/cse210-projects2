Version control is the tool that tracks the history of peopleâ€™s code or the code of a team, making it possible to keep a clear record of everything that has been done. One of the biggest benefits of version control is that a group of people can be working on the same project, using different computers, and being in different locations, yet everyone can still have access to this same project. For example, if a company is working on a project, anyone who makes any change in the code will have it registered, and the rest of the group will be able to know who made the changes and what the changes were. This ensures collaboration is smooth and mistakes are easier to track or fix. To manage this, commands are used in version control systems such as Git. A common one is git commit -m "<changes made>", which will commit the work into the project on your computer while keeping a history of what was done.
